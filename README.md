This is a **Minecraft Forge** mod and adds a **Solar Cooker** to the game.

![All Furnaces](material/logo.png)

It acts like a furnace but needs sunlight instead of fuel.

In default configuration all smoking recipes are working in the Solar Cooker, and they need 4 times more time than in a vanilla Smoker.

The mod is configurable, and you can change the recipes to "smelting" or "blasting". You can configure the cook time factor and blacklist recipes as well as add recipes via datapacks.
